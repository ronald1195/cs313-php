    <p class="description"> Hey there! <br /><br />
                            I'm a computer science major here at BYU - Idaho. I focus on developing iOS applications
                            for mobile devices and in SQL/PLSQL. I love coding and I've learned a lot since I started
                            college. Now I'm a junior, expecting to be graduated by next summer or fall of 2020. After
                            that the plan is to move to BYU and pursue a masters/phd degree in computer science and
                            focus my career a little bit more in mobile development.</p>
                         <p>Some things that I can tell you about me is that I'm from Guatemala, the most amazing country,
                            okay maybe not but I still love it. I'm 22 years old (almost 23) and I've never been more single
                            in my life than right now :) It's okay, but I'm thinking on postulating for ministering angel.
                            I like things like long-boarding and road trips. I'm not an enemy of hikes but I love to watch movies
                            and TV shows on netflix. Don't get confused though, I'm not the typical CS major, I say this because
                            I dont like video games(something that apparently is like a religion in de CS department.)</p>

                                                  I went to the dunes here in St. Anthony with my roomates and Maddie(my brother's
                                                  girlfriend) because we wanted to go sand-boarding. It was super fun you should try it
                                                    sometime soon. Be ready for the sand to get EVERYWHERE!</p>
